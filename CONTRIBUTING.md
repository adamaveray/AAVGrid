Contributing
============

Before you start developing, you should run `$ pod install` in the root directory. Then you're ready to go!

Pull requests are fun. Just open a new one if you have changes you'd like to contribute!


Tests
-----

There are tests for all "public" methods on the `AAVGrid` class, using the XCTest framework. If you are adding new functionality or fixing a bug, please add tests to cover those cases.
